# Tee-Together
Tee-Together is a semester long application created as a project for CSCI 430. The app allows users to create a golfing scorecard and link scorecards with other users. The app was built in Android Studio and was primarily tested on a Pixel 6. Firebase is used to store the backend information and the application is primarily written in Kotlin. 

####Testing
A number of unit tests were created to ensure verification of code functionality. Tests are written using the JUnit framework and can be easily run by building and running the 'ExampleInstrumentedTest.kt' file within Android Studio.
